            <p>Bus services were affected across Maharashtra and most of the shops and commercial establishments remained closed today in the wake of the bandh called across Maharashtra by three partners in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to protest the killing of four farmers in Uttar Pradesh''s Lakhimpur Kheri district.
                Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress - the three ruling allies- have appealed to people to wholeheartedly support the bandh, which began at midnight, to express their solidarity with farmers.
                
                Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said his party will take part in "full force" in the bandh. "All the three parties will actively participate in the bandh. What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri was a murder of the Constitution, a violation of the law and a conspiracy to kill farmers of the country," Mr Raut told reporters.
                
                The state BJP has warned the state government not to shut shops forcefully.</p>
